			<h2>Tyrant Football</h2>
			<p>
				Being a Tyrant is about working hard on the field, and playing hard 
				off it. Whether you&apos;re making a game-saving tackle in the final 
				quarter of a playoff game or partying in Europe on our annual sports 
				tour, it&apos;s about giving everything, not only for you, but for the 
				team. It&apos;s about being willing to learn and better yourself, both as 
				a player and as a person.
